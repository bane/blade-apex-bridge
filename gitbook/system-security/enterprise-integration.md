# Enterprise Integration

## System Security Architecture

The following high-level logical diagram represents a baseline architecture for system's security considerations. Each step in the diagram plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of our data and systems. This image will serve as the foundation upon which we will elaborate on different views per NIST CSF 2.0 (see[ here](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/nist-releases-version-20-landmark-cybersecurity-framework)).

![High-level Logical Architecture: Data Flow](../.gitbook/assets/2.jpeg)

Each step is meticulously designed to contribute to the overall security posture, encompassing various layers of defense and control. However, it is crucial to elaborate main data flow steps before explaining security controls and how system meets security requirements as per NIST CSF 2.0:

***

**Step 1**&#x20;

In this initial step, an enterprise user leverages the existing sign-in mechanisms, with Single Sign-On (SSO) support available if the enterprise Identity Management (IdM) system allows integration with external IdM providers. At this stage, the assumption is that the user is authenticated through conventional means, having a claims-based token that contains their username and role within the broader enterprise system. This authentication process forms the foundation for the user's access to the enterprise's systems and resources, ensuring secure and authorized entry.

***

**Step 2**

In this step, utilizing a Single Page Application (SPA), the user initiates transactions by sending crypto tokens to other users within the enterprise system. This process may involve integrating into the enterprise's internal directories of employees, empowering the web User Experience (UX) to enforce only allowed transactional activities among users within the enterprise. Through this approach, the system ensures that all transactions are conducted within the defined boundaries of authorization, promoting secure and controlled interactions while leveraging the organization's internal resources for seamless and compliant user transactions.

Even though the underlying system will use a blockchain (Blade), at this step, users do not possess either public or private keys. All the keys are stored within the cloud boundary, managed by the vendor for the enterprise as part of the service.
{% endhint %}

***

**Step 3**

During this stage, the process involves traversing a trust boundary, where the exposed service is the Transaction Coordinator. This coordinator is responsible for verifying the validity of user transactions and ensuring the creation of a proper blockchain transaction by utilizing the specific user's private key. By performing these verification and validation steps, the system maintains the integrity and security of the transactions, leveraging blockchain technology to secure and authenticate the transactional data. This ensures that all user transactions are authenticated and recorded accurately within the blockchain, enhancing the overall trust and transparency of the enterprise system.

Furthermore, it serves the purpose of scaling the cloud architecture by loosely coupling blockchain nodes with the enterprise authorization logic. This process is ensured through steps from 3 to 8. Starting with step 3, the Transaction Coordinator extracts the public key (e.g. the user’s wallet address) from an internal caching service which stores the map of user ids and their respective public key.

***

**Step 4**&#x20;

In this phase, with the user's identification for initiating a transaction and details of the recipient user, authorization procedures are implemented. These procedures involve validating whether the users have the authorization to engage in the transaction. This is achieved by cross-referencing with Identity and Access Management (IaM) systems to confirm the users' transaction privileges, as well as their active employment status within the enterprise. This step essentially serves as a verification check to ensure that the User Experience (UX) successfully enforced the transactional restrictions as established in step 2. By validating the authorization and user status, the system upholds compliance and security measures, reinforcing the integrity of the transactional processes within the enterprise system.

***

**Step 5**

&#x20;Upon completion of the thorough validation and verification checks in previous steps, and upon TC confirming that all necessary criteria are met, the TC proceeds to utilize the user's private key to generate an actual blockchain transaction.

***

**Step 6**

&#x20;By leveraging the user's private key, the TC ensures the secure and authenticated creation of the blockchain transaction, thereby preserving the integrity and confidentiality of the transactional data. To leverage a user's private key, the service needs to acquire the private key from the Key Management Service by leveraging the user's public key.

***

**Step 7**

In this scenario, to achieve architectural decoupling and establish independence of blockchain nodes from the enterprise's authorization layer, the Transaction Coordinator (TC) is required to sign its message related to the blockchain transaction intended for the blockchain's REST APIs. This signing process serves as a parallel step and involves importing the public key of the TC to the blockchain nodes. By doing so, the TC can sign the transaction message, enabling its secure transmission to the blockchain's REST APIs. This parallel step is crucial as it facilitates subsequent verification in step 9, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the message thus ensuring blockchain nodes can trust the process happening within the cloud boundary but outside the blockchain native cryptographic process. By integrating the public key of the TC with the blockchain nodes, the enterprise reinforces the robustness and reliability of the blockchain transaction processes, thereby enhancing the overall security and transparency of the system. Most importantly, by relying on message integrity, the security of the system architecture is not reliant only on network security between blockchain nodes and the enterprise authorization process.

***

**Step 8**

Transaction Coordinator (TC) uses a prepared blockchain transaction, signs it with its private key, and then invokes a REST API to submit the transaction.

***

**Step 9**

The REST API verifies the authenticity of the message by checking the signature to ensure it indeed comes from the transaction coordinator (TC). This verification is possible because the public key was imported in a parallel process, as described in step 7, allowing the API to validate the source of the message.

***

**Step 10**

This step marks the culmination of the transaction process, as the validated transaction details by blockchain nodes are leveraging inherent secure design and cryptography of blockchain networks, establishing an immutable record of the transaction. This process enhances the trustworthiness and transparency of the transactional activities within the enterprise ecosystem.

In NIST CSF 2.0, there are six functions encompassing requirement specifications, which will be described in subsequent chapters. Notably, the "Protect" function holds the most applicable requirements for the view of the architecture we are examining. This focus on protection aligns with our emphasis on fortifying our security posture and safeguarding our systems and data.

## Key Takeaways

This section emphasizes the system security and importance of confidentiality within Blade, particularly in cloud execution environments. The discussion highlights key considerations for ensuring data protection within the Blade framework:

1. Secure Communication with TLS encryption:
   1. Between Nodes: the underlying protocol is gRPC.
   2. Between Blockchain Users and Nodes: the underlying protocol is HTTP(S)
2. Secure Node Data: Implement encryption for data at rest to safeguard blockchain node data stored on disk. Utilize encryption with KMS keys or compatible file-system-level encryption or database encryption solutions.
3. Secure Node Private Keys: Utilize Key Management Services (KMS) to securely store and manage private keys. KMS solutions offer hardware security modules (HSMs) for cryptographic storage, ensuring that keys remain protected against unauthorized access.
4. Mitigations to information disclosure threats, and in case of sensitive applications, **clearly recommends** confidential computing for data in use encryption to complement data at rest encryption, while TLS 1.2+ is recommended for data in transit encryption.
